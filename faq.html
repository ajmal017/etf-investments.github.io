    <h1> etf.investments - Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <li><strong>What is etf.investments?</strong>
     etf.ivestments is a site that monitors and highlights daily ETF Fund Flows </li>
     <li><strong> Why? </strong>  ETFs allow us to monitor prices and fund flows acoss sectors, factors, investment styles and countries. This page calculates flows for yesterday, last 1 month and last 3 months for a select set of ETFs. Monitoring these statistics gives us an understanding on where money is moving. We may be able to discern whether returns are driven by flows or fundamentals. Some flows, especially for US Sector SPDRs, SPY, MDY or QQQ may be due to "funding trades" conducted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_One">Delta One</a> desks. In these scenarios, short-term flows may be disconnected from actual thematic investment ideas.</li>
    <li><strong>What universe do you cover?</strong>
     US ETFs </li>
    <li><strong>Where do you get your data?</strong>
     ETF fund flows are derived from daily shares outstanding numbers. This is publicly available data that can be found on most ETF issuer's fund page.</li>
    <li><strong>How timely is your data?</strong>
     We make every effort to get the latest information around fund flows and update the site before the US market open. Intraday pricing data is provided for free by IEX via their API.</li>
    <li><strong>What is a creation or redemption?</strong>
     Creations and redemptions are the mechanism by which you can trade directly with the ETF Fund. Only Authorized Participants can trade in this way. Monitoring ETF fund flows effectively monitors the net daily creations-redemption activity.</li>
    <li><strong>What is VolProj or Volume Projection</strong>
     Volume Projection = (Current Volume / ADV ) / Typical % VWAP Completion at EST Time
    <li><strong>Are there minimum AUM thresholds an ETF must reach to appear on the site?</strong>
     Yes, in most cases the fund must have at least $5mm in assets to appear. The exception is for the "Newest ETF Listings" page.
    <li><strong>How timely are the flows?</strong>
     Our flow statistics are delayed by 2 business days.
    <li><strong>When are numbers updated?</strong>
     Intraday numbers are updated in near realtime thanks to IEX API. Flows and returns are re-calculated around 8AM EST.
